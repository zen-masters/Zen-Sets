Gumroad | BlenderMarket | Discord Main Features Intuitive UI with multifunctional N-Panel , Pie menu and Workspace Tool . Display System that helps find and select each Group by displaying it by color in the viewport. Zen Sets Workspace Tool for fast switching between Elements Modes. It also provides a simulation of Zbrush Polygroup behavior for Selecting and Hiding Groups in Parts Mode. Import / Export Zen Sets Groups to native Vertex Groups, Face Maps, Vertex Colors, and vice versa. Auto Groups Operator to create Groups automatically from linked faces. Create Objects from Groups Operator . Divide mesh into Objects using Zen Sets Groups. Assign Materials to Groups Operator . Possibility to use Zen Sets Groups by external operators .
