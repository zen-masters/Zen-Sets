This copy are new objects, which share data-blocks with the original objects (by default, all the materials, textures, and F-curves), but which has copied others, like the mesh, for example. That is why this form of duplication is sometimes called shallow link , because not all data-blocks are shared; some of them are hard copied ! Duplicate Collection Linked \uf0c1 You also have the choice of creating a Linked Duplicate rather than a Duplicate; this is called a deep link . This will create a new object with all of its data linked to the original object. If you modify one of the linked objects in Edit Mode, all linked copies are modified. Transform properties (object data-blocks) still remain copies, not links, so you still can rotate, scale, and move freely without affecting the other copies.
