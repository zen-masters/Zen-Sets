# Troubleshooting

## — I can't find Zen Sets panel in the N-panel
— The Zen Sets panel is only present in **Edit Mode**
## — I don't see Auto Groups in Face Sets mode
— Auto Groups is located only in Face Parts mode. You may create groups with 'Auto Groups' option in Face Parts mode and copy them to any other Zen Sets mode
